# 100 Days of Python 🐍

This repository is my personal “100 Days of Python” journey — a collection of Python scripts, exercises and small projects I’m working on daily to improve my skills and build a solid foundation in Python.

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen core Python skills (syntax, data types, control flow, functions, etc.).  
- Practice daily and build consistency in coding.  
- Explore different Python concepts — from basics to more advanced topics like OOP, file handling, algorithms, etc.  
- Maintain a portfolio of small projects & practice exercises that I can refer to later.  

## 📁 Project Structure

Each day’s work is stored in a separate file (for example `pythonday1.py`, `pythonday2.py`, …). Each file contains the code for that day’s exercises or project.
